# book-appointment
a doctor to patient appointment booking app with the help of javapilot libraries . for now it is implemented as a single page with php and mysql as database usnig PDO. if u want the separated versions as in to be able to use them independently or using procedural php method or integrating i can also help you with it .
how it works....
click on manager allow the calendar to roll uptop the current date if it doesn't kindly refresh maybe your network might be slow since is javascript. select only from the whites boxes in the middle. each line represents a doctor's line . once you're done clicking on any of the middle boxes a small modal will fill up the box you clicked.

then click on public you will see a modal fill indicating that the doctor clicked is available. click on the modal fill and enter your name then save.

then click on doctors you will see the selected modal fill click on it and set appointment status to either free , waiting, or confirmed.

once that time has passed the public cannot see the available time again . ie if u click on manager and select say 3pm while the time is 4pm. the doctors might see it but the public can't because the time has already passed .
